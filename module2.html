    <h2>Module 2: TCP Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the default transport protocol of the Internet.
      It transmits by breaking data down into packets, and then waits to recieve acknowledgement packets
      to ensure that all of the data was received by the destination. TCP breaks down packet transmission into 
      four seperate layers; physical, network, transport, and application. Each of these layers has a different
      responsibility and role within packet transmission, which will be described in this module [2].
